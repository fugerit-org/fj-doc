=== What is Fugerit Venus Doc

Fugerit Venus Doc is a document generation framework.

It is based a xref:#doc-format-entry-point[source format] to describe the document structure (available in XML (default), JSON, YAML and Kotlin).

It heavenly relies on link:https://freemarker.apache.org[Apache FreeMarker] for source format composition.

The source format can be rendered to different output formats through xref:#doc-handlers[Doc Handlers]. (the actual rendering often depends on other open source libraries like link:https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/[Apache FOP] or link:https://opencsv.sourceforge.net/[OpenCSV]).
