# Fugerit Document Generation Framework (fj-doc)

## Apache FOP Render (PDF)(fj-doc-mod-fop)

[back to fj-doc index](../README.md)  

*Status* :  
Most feature implemented. (Sample JUnit [TestFreeMarker01Fop](../fj-doc-sample/src/test/java/test/org/fugerit/java/doc/sample/freemarker/TestFreeMarker01Fop.java) is now working).
  
*Since* : fj-doc 0.3
  
*Native support*  :  
Disabled, native support will be added in a future release. Apache FOP native support must be verified.
  
*Quickstart* :  
Basically this is only a type handler, see core library [fj-doc-base](../fj-doc-base/README.md).  
NOTE: If you have any special need you can open a pull request or create your own handler based on this.
